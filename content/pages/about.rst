My name is Max Korinets, 36 (to 2015) and I am a World Wide Web fan since my 18.
I like clarity, order and straightforward approach. I also tend to automate
things and remove human factor. Being a perfectionist, I don't take things
seriously until they're perfect (i. e. never) though I endlessly try to make
them such.

I was raised in a family of a graphic designer and an economist, attended an
art school and got some musical education from my grandfather. As a child I
was interested in photography, computers and games.

History
=======

I was introduced to the Internet in 1996 while attending `Moscow Internet Expo`.
A year later I managed to launch my first homepage at `geocities
<http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities>`_. I got some "excellent" marks at
the University by simply providing my professors with requested information
(which couldn't be obtained by other means) found through Alta Vista or Yahoo.
I worked for some time at the campus internet cafe, where I studied HTML
and Flash and also made my first website for money.

Later, I tried myself in webdesign and frontend but neither was satisfying:
it took too much time to come up something decent and frontend (the
cross-browser aspect in particular) was rather boring. My backend colleagues,
on the other hand, impressed me much -- they had power project-wise and
were in huge demand. So, I recalled my Informatics teacher positive
characteristics on me and the fact that I have won the second prize in our
local programming contest (Turbo Pascal) at high school, and plunged into the
backend world.

The first thing I tried was `e107 <http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/E107_CMS>`_ --
a big clumsy CMS that did some job for me. Working with it revealed the value
of flexibility, most of the PHP systems were lacking of.

Next was the series of usual PHP stuff a self-educated developer had to face:
Joomla, Mambo, ..., etomite. The last one was surprisingly light and flexible
and coped with exotic tasks easily. There also was a fork of it, called `MODx`
which had a huge potential and became my tool of choice for years to come.
Furthermore `I founded the Russian MODx Community
<http://modx.ru/novosti-i-stati/article/50/>`_ and had been leading it for
some time.

Eventually the time came when MODx wasn't enough and I started to look for
something even more flexible, the *frameworks*. There was a hype around
`Ruby On Rails`, and I did a couple of test projects on it. Unfortunately I
couldn't handle the new language easily so I fled back to PHP to try `Symfony`
and `CodeIgniter`. While mastering the frameworks I started to see new horizons for
myself as a webdev: I felt like I could do anything! An online-shop, a
corporate system with intranet, a bank account system (no, of course)! The only
thing left was to choose the *right* framework. The framework that doesn't fail,
has active community, is backed by serious people and is kind of
enterprise-level. And in PHP that, of course, was `Zend Framework`, so I
invested all of my time in it for the next couple of years.

I did quite a few large projects on ZF: a couple of online-shops, a sports game
video catalogue and a model system called `Whyte Model`_. Some time later I
realized that I liked `Object Oriented Programming` very much and PHP was not so
object oriented by design. I felt the need to switch to a *naturally* OO
language. I looked at `Ruby` again for a little bit but finally decided to start
learning `Python`.

Python gave me the real passion for programming. Its rules (functional indentation,
PEP8, importing), `readabilty-first` concept, general matureness, that academic
flavour convinced me I made the right choice. I was also impressed by the vast
number of areas where Python was employed: desktop apps, web, science,
3D-modeling, etc.

I write in Python nowadays -- this blog works on Pelican and is written in
`reStructured <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, a Python
documentation language.

I even have a funny `cv in Python <{filename}/pages/cv.rst#id11>`_.

.. note:: I used to use `yentsun` nickname for a long time. The word does not
          mean anything at all. There are people in Asia with this family name
          and that is a coincidence. I guess this nickname came from the Mortal
          Kombat game, where there was a character called Shang Tsung.
