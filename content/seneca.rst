My experience with Senecajs
===========================

:abstr: I've known Senecajs and microservices for just a couple of months and
        got very excited about them. Seems like I'm a little bit closer to a
        perfect architecture for complex software
:lang: en

Having received a task - ‘to build a microservice’ - I started to dig what the
term means and what tools there are to help develop one. Suddenly I felt that
I am onto something big and beautiful.

First, I watched some videos and read the great (in some way definitive)
`article by Martin Fowler <http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html>`_
and then next week I’ve been building `a decentralized system
<https://github.com/venture-game>`_ with Seneca as a home project.

Seneca may seem a bit immature at first glance but it actually is not. It has a
versatile `action patterns <http://senecajs.org/get-started/#how-patterns-work>`_
to route methods to. A Seneca microservice can easily be covered with tests.
It has a straightforward storage mechanism (Active Record-like) and `plugin system
<http://senecajs.org/tutorials/how-to-write-a-plugin.html>`_ to abstract and
organize the code.

I’ve yet to try Python frameworks to make a good comparison, but I really am
happy with `Senecajs <http://senecajs.org/>`_!
